## Previous blog

When I was a sophomore in college, I learned about Hexo from Bilibili up called [CodeSheep](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yb411a7ty), I'm happy to share, so I spent some time building my first blog. Unfortunately, I'm a bit too obsessed with changing themes, while I want to focus more on technology, and for some other reasons, I don't like Hexo very much.

In the following years, I tried one after another markdown platform, like [Juejin](https://juejin.cn/), [wolai](https://www.wolai.com/) and so on.

But I'm a bit OCD, I always think some parts don't look good, such as the font, such as the layout, and contains a lot of spam.

## echoeureka.me

I built this blog when I in my fourth year of university, I was a intern at [trip.com](trip.com), they use server-side render, so I learned nextjs, I need to make something to deepen your understanding of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), I decided to re-make my blog with super power ssg and ssr of Next.js.

### Tribute

- [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/)
  I like VitePress very much, but I use react now.
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
  A powrful document tool, but not a blog tool. The biggest problem is that its theme is too ugly and not easy to make your own, and as a meta product, it seems do not like TypeScript.

### Tech

- Next.js
  SSG and SSR with React.
- Markdown-it
  Easier to understand than [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/).
- [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/)
  For SSR part api, frequently changed content.
